        As you progress through this book you will begin to realise how complex computer systems really are. By the time you reach Chapter 10 you should have a 
        better understanding of the fundamentals behind computers themselves and the 
        software that controls them.
        You will learn that any form of data needs to be converted into a binary format 
        so that it can be processed by the computer.
        However, no matter how complex the system, the basic building block in all 
        computers is the binary number system. This system is chosen because it only 
        consists of 1s and 0s. Since computers contain millions and millions of tiny 
        ‘switches’, which must be in the ON or OFF position, they can be represented by 
        the binary system. A switch in the ON position is represented by 1; a switch in 
        the OFF position is represented by 0.
